##ManyKeyboard copyright (C) 2013 Nan Li.

ManyKeyboard is a BSD licensed Java library based on javahidlib to allow multiple keyboard to be captured on a single computer.


###Background
Native JDK support only one mouse and one keyboard. Manymouse project (https://icculus.org/manymouse/) was created to allow multiple mice working in a single application. This manymouse library is originally in C, but has Java port.

Mutiple keyboard on a single computer has not attracted many people, but it is useful in a collaborative setting. Many people have created libraries or found ways to enable multiple keyboard to work within a .Net application. I am always seeking a way to make it work on every OS platform (Windows, Linux and OSX). 

With the help of javahidlib, I am able to create this small library to support multiple keyboard.
